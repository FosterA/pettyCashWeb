# PettyCash
This project is an Angular web application using PhaserJS and Plaid Mock Transaction data to demonstrate how to build a single page application.
- Our Project is being completed alongside a similar iOS application (repo to be posted soon maybe)
- PettyCash uses Apple's Cloudkit authentication and data storage solution so an Apple ID is required
-  Currently this project is in dev mode only, so new users are unable to be added. Feel free to browse and borrow our implementation if you should need help learning these tools.
